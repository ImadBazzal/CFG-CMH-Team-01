Modern States Problem Statement: How might a technology solution help Modern Solutions make it easier on the front end for learners, families, college advisors, and institutional partners (community stakeholders) to find up to date information about where they can use their CLEP exam scores to get college credit that moves them towards their degree goals - while also on the back end simplifying the process for colleges and universities to keep their CLEP acceptance policies up to date and for community stakeholders to add context about acceptance policies?

Key Problems We Addressed: 
- Broken/lack of recent data
- No APIs
- Lack of an accessible and easy way for institutions to update their CLEP policies
- Centralizing information in one application

Our Solution and Features:
- Search by CLEP exam type and CLEP score and Results Page with Map View and Filters (exam type, CLEP score, institution policy last updated, city, state, transcription fee)
- Ability for learners to "Report Oudated Institution Information" for specific institutions and exam types
- Institution login and streamlined way for institutions to update their policies
- Admin login and dashboard showing useful information (ex. number of policies reported by students, acceptance by subject, top states, etc.)
- AI Chatbot: Allows students to input their specific situation and generate detailed responses of schools and credit information based on the input. 

Future Visions:
- AI Chatbot
- Connecting backend fully and populating with real data
- Admin Dashboard

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, Supabase
